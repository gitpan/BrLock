BrLock is a module featuring a distributed lock, using the algorithm
Carvalho and Roucariol, On mutual exclusion in computer networks,
ACM Communications, Feb83. 

The algorithm features minimal messages for acquiring the next lock, 
but with the trade-off of network being reliable enough to ensure that
all nodes are alive. In fact, one node won't be able to acquire the 
next lock if it can't communicate to all other nodes, unless the node
was the last one to acquire the lock. 

If this is a hard constraint for you, you may want to use IPC::Lock.
